# EQUIVALENT RESISTANCE CALCULATOR
Electrical Parameter Calculator is a simple application which can be used by any technical field students for calculations. We can use this application to find Equivalent Resistance of Series or Parallel Combination. Moreover calculation of Capacitance and Inductance can also de done in similar way by adding additional program. In this project i will be implementing some operation to find equivalent resisatnce using C language.

1.Designed an Electrical Parameter Calculator for Resistors which are in Series and Parallel.

2.Easy to calculate by entering the number of Resistors and their each Value.

3.Calculation of Capacitors and Inductances can also be obtained by similar operation, assigning the formula.

Calculation in :

               1.Resistors in Series
               
               2.Resistors in Parallel

# INTRODUCTION
Electrical Parameter Calculator is a simple application which can be used by any technical field students for calculations. 
We can use this application to find Equivalent Resistance of Series or Parallel Combination.
Moreover calculation of Capacitance and Inductance can also de done in similar way by adding additional program.
In this project i will be implementing some operation to find equivalent resisatnce using C language.

### 1. Resistance in Series
A Series circuit is a circuit in which the resistor is arranged where tail of one is connected to head of other. 
A series circuit is a circuit in which resistors are arranged in a chain, so the current has only one path to take. The current is the same through each resistor. 
The total resistance of the circuit is found by simply adding up the resistance values of the individual resistors.
##Equivalent resistance of resistors in series : R = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...
### 2. Resistance in Parallel
A parallel circuit is a circuit in which the resistors are arranged with their heads connected together, and their tails connected together. 
The current in a parallel circuit is different in each resistor along each parallel branch and re-combining when the branches meet again. The voltage across each resistor in parallel is the same.
The total resistance of a set of resistors in parallel is found by adding up the reciprocals of the resistance values, and then taking the reciprocal of the total:
##Equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel: 1 / R = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + 1 / R3 +...


# RESEARCH
As Technology is enhancing day by day and time saving factor is also important. As Calculation is an important factor as it is involved in our daily life.
It is difficult to perform the task of calculation manually as the number of resistors increases the time also increases and chances to get correct output is very low but using this application you can exactly find output on one click only.
There exist many different calculators like simple calculator, scientific calculator etc. So to make ease in the calculation of the Electrical Parameters,a calculator has been designed to make fast calculation.
Most importantly for Science, Engineering and Technology students this calculator made their work easy. Further, Program can be modified and added to include Capacitance and Inductance calculations and many more.
Meanwhile, Idea is been used and research and development techniques to improve the technology for multi-purposes.
